holy cow! lick balls


I am a banana nut muffin!


If you want a recipe for restless sleep, I can give you one. Add one part "what will my wife think" with 3,000 parts Benjamin Franklin; stir in a "beer anytime you damn well please" and top with a chance at financial independence.

I've become pretty good one of those around.

In the end, just as Indiana Jones could never turn down the opportunity to search for the Holy Grail, I could no less turn down the chance to work for myself on something I truly love, no matter how safe the alternative might be. When I'm old and dying, I plan to look back on my life and say "wow, that was an adventure," not "wow, I sure felt safe."
